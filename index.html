            <h1>Basics on BiDi/RTL and challenges</h1>
            <h2>What countries and how many people speak Arabic and Hebrew</h2>
            <p>
                Arabic and Hebrew languages are native to more than 600 million people in developing economies. Arabic language is native for over 295 million people, plus it is used by 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide. There are over 5 million Hebrew native speakers all over the world. Also, there are over 310 million people who speak one of ten major languages based on the Arabic script and writing system: Farsi (Persian), Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Uyghur, Sindhi, Malay (Jawi), Kazakh, Kurdish, and Kyrgyz. In this article we will focus mostly on Arabic (Ar) and Hebrew (He), those are languages already supported by Esri software.

            <p>Arabic was just a small language several years ago used on internet. In 2015, it did not feature even in the top ten languages used on the internet, but has grown to become one of the most used languages online. As of 2013, only 37% of Arabic speakers were connected to the internet, but today there are more than 168.1 million Arabic internet users worldwide. The language just misses out on the top three spots, but it can change in near future. </p>

            <h2>Why these languages are called Bidirectional</h2>
            <p>Text written in the Hebrew and Arabic languages is often referred to as bidirectional, or "BiDi" for short. Arabic and Hebrew are written predominantly right-to-left. Numbers are written with the most significant digit left-most, just as in European or other left-to-right text.</p>
            <p><img src='img/EuropeanFlowWithNumbers.png' alt='European flow of numbers and words (everything from left to right)' title='European flow of numbers and words (everything from left to right)'><br>European flow of numbers and words (everything from left to right)</p>
            <p><img src='img/ArabicFlowWithNumbers.png' alt='Arabic flow of numbers and words (mixed directions)' title='Arabic flow of numbers and words (mixed directions)'><br>Same text in Arabic. Flow of numbers and words (words go from right to left; numbers go from left to right)</p>
            
            <p>Languages written in left-to-right scripts are often mixed in, so the complete document is bidirectional in nature, a mix of both right-to-left and left-to-right writing. </p>
            <p><img src='img/BiDiTextNumbers.png' alt='BiDi text' title='BiDi text'><br>Text says: The following new tools are available in the ArcGIS Enterprise portal</p>
            
            <p>BiDi languages pretty much never go vertical. The only intuitive way to achieve vertical BiDi script is to start with a standard line of horizontal RTL text and rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise so that it points downward.</p>

            <p><img src="img/ArabicVertical.jpg"  alt="Incorrect vertical text direction" title="Incorrect vertical text direction"> <img src="img/ArabicRTL.jpg"  alt="Correct text direction" title='Correct RTL text direction'></p>
            <p>
                Reading right-to-left means the whole experience — not just the line of text — is right-to-left. Books are alphabetized on a shelf RTL. Books open from what Westerners would consider the back cover. A sequence of instructional steps must go in RTL direction. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Strong and Weak/Neutral characters</h2>
            <p>The order of characters in memory (logical) is not the same as the order in which they are displayed (visual). The set of rules applied by the software to produce the correct order at the time of display are described by the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm, or 'bidi algorithm' for short.</p>
            <p>How does the software know whether this is a sequence of left-to-right or right-to-left characters? Because each character in Unicode has an associated directional property. Most letters are <strong>strongly typed</strong> as LTR (left-to-right). Letters from right-to-left scripts are strongly typed as RTL (right-to-left).</p>
            <p>The order in which text is displayed depends on the base direction assigned to the phrase, paragraph or block that contains it.</p>
            <p>Spaces and punctuation are not strongly typed as either LTR or RTL, because they may be used in either type of script. They are therefore classed as <strong>neutral</strong> or <strong>weak</strong> characters. A neutral character between two strongly typed characters that have the same directional type will also assume that directionality. </p>
            <p>More information about Strong & Weak characters can be found in <a href='https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics' target="_blank">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a></p><br>

                <p>The process of recreating LTR graphics, text, content and user interface for RTL or BiDi is tricky and will be discussed separately. The ‘just mirror the whole thing’ approach does not work. </p>

            <h2>Letter Forms and Ligatures </h2>
            <p>
                BiDi scripts are inherently cursive, which means that each BiDi script has multiple letter forms, depending whether it’s used at the start, middle, or end of the word — and there’s a standalone (detached) form. Hebrew has only five letters with both a normal form and a final form. In Arabic script, certain letters can only connect with other letters on the right side, but not the left. This creates slight breaks in the script flow that are subtly smaller than breaks between words.

            <p>Arabic letters can also take different shapes, or ligatures, depending on the other letters around them. The letters are combined, or “stacked” in different ways, based on which letters are being written.  </p>

            <p>Both Hebrew and Arabic alphabets have 24 characters. Please note that some characters should be written differently depending on their position in the word (beginning, middle, end and stand-alone). Sometimes browsers like IE11 and Edge display Arabic text as disjoined characters, it is a bug. </p>

                <h2>Numerals. Wast Arabic (European) vs Arabic-Indic</h2>
            
            <p>The Arabic-Indic numerals are decimal based numbers used in Arabic and Farsi speaking countries. They are one of the oldest sets of numerals still in use today, though the Western Arabic system used in European languages has become dominant in recent centuries. Although Arabic text is written right-to-left, numbers are written the same way as in left-to-right languages, with the most significant digit on the left. The number 123 (one hundred and twenty three) is written ١٢٣ ("123", not "321").</p>
            <p><img src='img/Numerals.png' alt="Western and Indic Arabic numerals"><br>Western and Indic Arabic numerals</p>
            
            <details>
		    <summary>Arabic numerals and numbers support (optional)</summary>
            <p>“Indic” are used in some, but not all Arabic-speaking countries. ArcGIS Pro supports both 'Western' and 'Indic' numerals. Mobile applications are re-using numerals from the system settings. Currently web applications are supposed to display only Western numerals. Some browsers are displaying a mixture of 'Western' and 'Indic' numbers, it is better to avoid such behavior.</p>

                <h1>Calendars</h1>
                <p>Hebrew calendar types:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Gregorian calendar</li>
                <li>Hebrew</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Hebrew calendar also called Jewish calendar, is a lunisolar calendar used today predominantly for Jewish religious observances. It determines the dates for Jewish holidays and the appropriate public reading of Torah portions, and daily Psalm readings, among many ceremonial uses. In Israel, it is used for religious purposes, provides a time frame for agriculture and is an official calendar for civil purposes, although the latter usage has been steadily declining in favor of the Gregorian calendar.</p>
            
            <p>Examples of short/long days of the week and months <i>- to be added</i> </p>
            
            <p>Main Arabic calendar types:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Hijri</li>
                <li>Gregorian</li>
                
            </ol>
            
            <p>Hijri (Islamic) calendar is based on the moon. Also known as the Hijri Calendar, it started after the Hijrah of the Prophet (PBUH) to Madina. The beginning of each month is contingent on the visibility of the moon at the end of the previous month. Once the moon is sighted, the new month commences. Each month starts with a new lunar cycle. Hence, the Muslim Calendar gives only a tentative overview of the upcoming Islamic dates as the start of each month is subject to the sighting of the moon. The Islamic calendar consists of 12 months similar to the Gregorian calendar. However, it consists of 354-355 days unlike the 365-366 days in the regular calendar.</p>
            
            <p>Examples of Arabic days of the week notation:</p>
            <ul class='calendar'>
                <li>ن	Monday</li>
                <li>
ث 	Tuesday</li>
                <li>
ر	Wednesday </li>

خ	Thursday </li>
                <li>
ج	Friday </li>
                <li>
س	Saturday </li>
                <li>
ح	Sunday </li>
</ul>
            
                        
            <p>While web applications are currently using Gregorian calendar only, mobile applications are relying on system settings, more advanced applications like ArcGIS Pro can work with country-specific calendars.</p>

            <h2>What not to flip</h2>
                <h3>Share, Import, Export, Download just like LTR, they do not have directional meaning.</h3>
                <p>If you are not sure whether the arrow or any icons that should be mirror, check with other applications such as MS outlook, words, AutoCAD and Adobe to find out how others are doing in RTL.

                <h3>Non-Directional Graphics and images</h3>
                <p>Graphics should not be mirrored at all, such as legal trademarks or logos because they will make no sense when laid out from right to left.<br>
                Images element especially all raster imageries should not be mirrored, otherwise, it will become useless and distorted.<br>
                Text reading order in the graphics should honor LTR or RTL, it should not blindly mirror everything.</p>
            <p>ESRI Style Scale bar with English Text</p>
            <p><img src='img/RTL_scalebars_noFlip.png'></p>

            <p><img src='img/RTLstylesIncorrect.png'</p>
                
                <h3>Charts, graphs & Histograms</h3>
            <p>Charts/Histograms should be like in English, except Hebrew/Arabic text reading order should be RTL and alignment should be to the right. Legend is neutral on the graph/chart, it does not has directional meaning, so the symbol can be on either size but the numeric value that contain greater than &gt; or smaller than  &lt; (e.g. &gt;1000, &lt; 999) should honor LTR reading order</p>
            <p><img src='img/histogramRTLnoFlip.png'</p>
            
            <details>
		  <summary><h3>URLs, File paths and English text</h3></summary>
          <p>Keep them LTR. NP if they will be right-aligned. </p>

                <p>Sometimes English text with punctuation may look not very good in RTL layouts. While there is no way to control user-defined text (which may be typed in any language), it is better to control the punctuation in "Always English" text like product names. You can use LTR tags to prevent browsers will force them to follow the LTR standard. For example:</p>
		  <p><img src="img/notebook_parenthesis.png" width=100% alt="ArcGIS Notebook Python 3 product name parenthesis display incorrectley"></p>
		  <p>Solutions: </p>
		  <p><xmp><option>ArcGIS Notebook Python 3 Standard (3.0)&lrm;</option>

<option dir="ltr">ArcGIS Notebook Python 3 Standard (3.0)</option>

		  <summary><h3>Date formats - Numbers are written LTR, text flow is RTL</h3></summary>
          <p>That means that if, for instance, we have date in dd/mm/yyyy format, the result will be 2019/12/31. Please use DOJO library and don’t forget about RTL tags. </p>
		</details><br><br>
                
                <h3>Formulas, Equations and measurement</h3>
<p>HTML, Python scripts, Dynamic text (e.g. XML) SQL statement and label expressions are standardize and they all remain LTR<br>
e.g. Dynamic text remain LTR</p>
            <p><img src='img/DynamicTextNoFlip.png'></p>

            <p>Model builder flow direction should remain LTR</p>
            
            <h3>Altitude and Azimuth point should remain unchanged</h3>
            <p>The azimuth point is the same in both dialogs, but the degrees number under the picture is different.
            The Altitude point, which "walks" on the curve, does not follow the curve in the Hebrew dialog.

		  <summary>Interactive elements moving in right or left direction should follow their direction</summary>
          <p>Examples are vertial separators between windows, right-align and left-align buttons.</p>
          <p>Here is a "bad example" when cursor is moving one side and vertical separator is moving opposite side. Avoid such behavior!</p>

          <p>Please ensure and test manually that if a tool has an arrow showing left side, it should move the element the same side as shown at the icon:</p>
